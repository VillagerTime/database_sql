Instead of having all of your data in one garbled mess of a table, you can organize the data into multiple tables grouped by whatever makes sense. All of the students' info is in one table, class data in another, locations in another, etc. all combining into one \"main\" table that only has two columns. By organizing data, it can be easier to see what you're trying to look for, and it'll be easier to manage because you only need one number to access information on a particular monster or class. Another key is to be simple. Just one, or maybe two words to describe the field or table. It doesn't need to be a long sentence, becuase it'll be more difficult to access data in the future if it's too long. Something that's unique, but also easy to read and remember."

If multiple new students join the class, all of them all start with 0. To make the process faster, and for us to be able to only add in the values we need to add, those defaults must be in place. I learned that it's fairly easy to add a constraint, and change the constraint if I messed something up in the process. I'm also going to add in contact emails and phone numbers for the different instructors in the database. If the need arises where a student needs to reach an instructor by phone or email, it's right there.
